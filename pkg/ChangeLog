============ 0.6 ============

0.6-13: Correction to DIC
0.6-12: DIC implemented
0.6-11: Allow frailty spline parameters to be 0
0.6-10: Option to plot marginal survival curves
0.6-9: Documentation and code comments
0-6-8: Minor update, added negbin prior
0.6-7: Prior for nknots selectable, including poisson, geometric, power,
poissonmix
0.6-6: Thinning option, second fvar estimator, predict and plot function
choice
0.6-5: Bugfixes to ensure that several unlikely combinations of inputs work,
and new predict and plot features
0.6-4: Added "mixed" option for candidate knot distribution
0.6-3: Speed improvements (recompute only the relevant portion of spline
basis) and stability fixes (fixed first frailty spline par at 0, candidate
knot boundary buffer)
0.6-2: Bugfixes (correct Jacobian for adaptive selection, initialization)
0.6-1: bdm branch merged in: adaptive knot selection by default, but p-spline
estimation can be toggled. Additional bugfixes.

============ 0.5 ============

0.5-4: Removed a frailty shrinkage penalty
0.5-3: Bugfixes caused by mixing branch
0.5-2: Fixed compiler warnings in Windows/Linux due to inline functions and
unused variables
0.5-1: Meanone branch merged in: frailties and the frailty density are updated in such a way that the mean is always 1.

============ OLDER ============

0.4: Mixing branch (each spline component updated separately for improved mixing)
0.3: Updated to use compiled code in C
0.2: First stable working package
0.1: Initial package created
